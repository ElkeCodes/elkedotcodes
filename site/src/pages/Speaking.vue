    <h2>‚õµÔ∏è Hoist the sails, we have TailwindCSS!</h2>
    <p class="text-tiny">Presented 14 September 2020 @ women.code(be)</p>
    <p>
      In this lightning talk of 15 minutes I introduce TailwindCSS. While most
      CSS frameworks provide pre-designed components , Tailwind CSS provides
      utility classes to style your frontend components from scratch. I show how
      to use it to build custom, responsive and maintainable designs without
      having to write CSS.

    <h2>üïπ Pacman VR in Vue</h2>
    <p class="text-tiny">Presented 27 February 2020 @ women.code(be)</p>
    <p>
      A lot of people have played the game Pacman before. But with the rising
      popularity of VR, how would it be to build a Pacman VR? Is it even
      possible to have a playable version on mobile? In this 40 minutes talk I
      dive into some history of Pacman and how it's linked to arcade gaming for
      women. After that I explain how I built a VR version of the popular arcade
      game with the help of Vue and A-frame.
