"Don't make me think" is a title that points out on of the first laws of good usability.
It guides you through the basic principles of intuitive navigation and information design.
When any user looks at a web page it should be self-evident, self-explanatory and obvious.
At the first glance of your web page, your user should find what he's looking for.
Whether that might be the job listings of your company or the buy button in your webshop.

Each millisecond extra that the user needs to find what he needs, adds on the user's cognitive workload.
The higher this cognitive workload becomes, the more likely the user will leave your web page as their frustration rises.
