excerpt: "In the NPM ecosystem, we have a tendency to always install NPM packages either locally or globally before we execute them. For example when we start a new project in a framework, it's one of the first steps to install the CLI of that framework after which you might not use the CLI anymore. So why would we install that CLI anyway?"
